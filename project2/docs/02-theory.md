## Artificial neural networks

*Artificial neural networks* (ANN) is a machine learning technique inspired by
the networks of neurons that make up the biological brain. There are several
different types of neural networks, and in this project I am using a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP), where we there is one or more *hidden layers* between
the input and output layers, and each hidden layer consists of several
*neurons*. The signal will only go in one direction, from the input layer to
the output layer, which makes this a *feedforward neural network* (FNN).
Additionally, all neurons of a layer will be connected to every neuron on the
previous layer, which makes it a *fully connected layer*. The details of how a 

The basic idea of a neural network is that the input information (i. e. the
features/predictors of our data set),
