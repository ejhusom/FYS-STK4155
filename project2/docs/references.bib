	abstract = {We present sport skill data analysis with time series data from motion pictures, focused on table tennis. We use neither body nor skeleton model, but use only hi-speed motion pictures, from which time series data are obtained and analyzed using data mining methods such as C4.5 and so on. We identify internal models for technical skills as evaluation skillfulness for forehand stroke of table tennis, and discuss mono and meta-functional skills for improving skills.},

	doi = {http://hdl.handle.net/10852/52702},
	abstract = {The aim of this thesis was to develop a mathematical model able to simulate heart rate during cycling exercise with power as input. From an optimization of free model parameters to fit the model to heart rate recordings, we wanted to extract information that possibly could indicate the health of subjects. Our model is based on physiological principles, and three physiologically interpreted parameters are being optimized. The parameters τL and νmin are assumed to predict the relative condition of a subjects, while the last parameter p ̄ T is as- sumed to predict the absolute performance of a subject. Maximal heart rate is the only subject dependent parameter that has to be known a priori as input to the model. Results in this thesis indicate that the model predicts parame- ters consistent within subjects, and parameter variations are observed between subjects. However, a further validation of the model is needed to decide if all parameters change as expected according to health of subjects, such that it can be used as a tool in training analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, quantitative view on the human athletic performance of individual runners. We obtain a predictor for running performance, a parsimonious model and a training state summary consisting of three numbers by application of modern validation techniques and recent advances in machine learning to the thepowerof10 database of British runners’ performances (164,746 individuals, 1,417,432 performances). Our predictor achieves an average prediction error (out-of-sample) of e.g. 3.6 min on elite Marathon performances and 0.3 seconds on 100 metres performances, and a lower error than the state-of-the-art in performance prediction (30\% improvement, RMSE) over a range of distances. We are also the first to report on a systematic comparison of predictors for running performance. Our model has three parameters per runner, and three components which are the same for all runners. The first component of the model corresponds to a power law with exponent dependent on the runner which achieves a better goodness-of-fit than known power laws in the study of running. Many documented phenomena in quantitative sports science, such as the form of scoring tables, the success of existing prediction methods including Riegel’s formula, the Purdy points scheme, the power law for world records performances and the broken power law for world record speeds may be explained on the basis of our findings in a unified way. We provide strong evidence that the three parameters per runner are related to physiological and behavioural parameters, such as training state, event specialization and age, which allows us to derive novel physiological hypotheses relating to athletic performance. We conjecture on this basis that our findings will be vital in exercise physiology, race planning, the study of aging and training regime design.},

	title = {Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks},
	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},
