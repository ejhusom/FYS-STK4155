In this project we study the predictive capabilities of logistic regresson and artificial neural networks on a binary classification problem. The methods are applied on a data set from a bank in Taiwan, where we aim to predict credit card holders default payments. Our findings have been compared with those of a recent scientific article, which uses different machine learning techniques applied to the same data set. We found neural networks to give the highest accuracy, with a score of $0.86$, where $0.64$ of the cases were classified as true positives and $0.92$ true negatives. We also use neural networks for linear regression on a set of generated terrain data, and compare its performance to the methods of ordinary least squares, ridge and lasso. Here we find that our neural network regressor, which gave a mean squared error of $0.0415$ on the test set, does not perform equally well as the more traditional regression methods, for example the Ordinary Least Squares method, which gave a test mean squared error of $0.0136$.
