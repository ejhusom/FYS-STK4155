# FYS-STK4155 Project 2: Logistic Regression and Neural Networks

The aim of this project was to compare a feedforward fully-connected artifical
neural network with 1) traditional logistic regression applied to a classification
problem, and 2) common regression methods, like the Ordinary Least Squares
method, Ridge regression and Lasso regression, when applied to a regression
problem.

See report in the `docs` folder for all information about the project.
